## Difference-in-differences for measuring cultural neighborhoods' resilience during Covid Pandemic: the Distritos Creativos in Buenos Aires

The proposal “Difference-in-differences for measuring cultural neighborhoods' resilience during Covid Pandemic: the Distritos Creativos in Buenos Aires” has been accepted to the 2022 ENCATC Education and Research Session.The event will take place in the framework of the 2022 ENCATC Annual Congress (17-19 October) on the theme of " Internationalization in focus:  theoretical, strategic and management perspectives in education, research, policy, and practice". 
It is a preliminary on-working paper. Further, I will transform it in a panel dataset and apply a fixed effects method to analyze it.

### Abstract
 Due to the Covid-19 Pandemic, the cultural industry was profoundly affected and, as a result, millions of workers worldwide lost their primary income sources. To bare with its impacts, different governments produced several policies and programs. Could already in-course cultural policies also help to attenuate the crisis? Specifically, do policies that foster cultural clusters, territories with a competitive advantage in specific neighborhoods of a city, also contributed to the resilience of cultural institutions in these territories? To answer these questions, we look at the specific case of the city of Buenos Aires and the Distritos Culturales policy, statistically analyzing the effects of the pandemic on the number of cultural centers and their incomes in 2020, in an attempt to differentiate the consequences of the initial shock caused by the pandemic in territories that are creative districts from those that are not. 
We employ the **Difference-in-Differences (DiD) method**. For its intuitive appeal (Fredriksson & Magalhães de Oliveira, 2019), DiD approaches were largely used to evaluate the impact, successes, and pitfalls of public policies during the pandemic (Alfano & Ercolano, 2020; Banerjee & Nayak, 2020). They have mainly focused, nevertheless, on actions concerned with the pandemic itself. Little has been used as been published on the impact in sectoral areas such as culture. In this paper, we apply the method following the guideline provided by Haber et al. (2021) comparing the outcome change in units that received intervention with those that did not. With governmental data, we account for the effect on the mean change of the number of cultural institutions and the mean change of their income, controlling also for the income range and the artistic manifestation type. 
Based on the use of the DiD method, the main objective of this paper is to assess whether, in the territories considered Creative Districts, cultural institutions were more resilient in the face of the pandemic shock in the cultural sector, resulting in a smaller reduction in the number of institutions and in their income than in territories without such program. Or if on the contrary, being in a creative district increases the chance of closing a cultural center, especially the ones with low income.

By observing the impact of a policy such as the Creative Districts, we seek to contribute to the debate about the validity of certain types of cultural policies in Latin America, understanding if a cultural policy focused on the creative industries, which largely contributed to an intense professionalization of the sector, increased economic gains, and cultural tourism, also converted these benefits into social gains and resilience for the cultural environment in neighborhoods. At the same time, by using data analysis we sought to contribute to the development of new quantitative methods for the evaluation of and proposition of evidence-based cultural policies, using data to assess how policies can disrupt the territory’s dynamics, creating different patterns of power, excluding or not cultural agents, and privileging or not certain types of cultural production.
